      <p>
        REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is a set of
        architectural principles that define how web services should be designed
        and structured. A REST API, or Representational State Transfer
        Application Programming Interface, is a way to interact with web
        services based on these principles. Here's what you need to know:
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2 font-semibold">Key Concepts of REST API:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Resources:</strong> In a RESTful API, everything is treated as
          a resource, which can be a data object, service, or even a concept.
          Each resource is uniquely identified by a URL.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>HTTP Methods:</strong> REST APIs use standard HTTP methods
          (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
          Delete) operations on resources.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Stateless:</strong> REST APIs are stateless, meaning each
          request from a client to the server must contain all the information
          needed to understand and fulfill that request. There is no session or
          client context stored on the server between requests.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Representation:</strong> Resources can have multiple
          representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients can request the
          representation they prefer.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Uniform Interface:</strong> A uniform and consistent interface
          simplifies interactions with the API. This includes using standard
          HTTP status codes for indicating the result of operations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2 font-semibold">Use Cases of REST APIs:</h2>
      <p>
        REST APIs are widely used in web development and various industries for
        building scalable and interoperable applications. Common use cases
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating web services for web and mobile applications.</li>
        <li>Accessing and manipulating data from databases.</li>
        <li>Integrating with third-party services and APIs.</li>
        <li>Building IoT (Internet of Things) applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Understanding REST APIs is crucial for developers as they form the
        backbone of many modern web and mobile applications, enabling seamless
        communication between different software systems.
